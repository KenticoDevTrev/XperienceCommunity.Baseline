# Starting Site
This is a starting sample site for your KX13 solution.  

This version is meant for ***KX13 Hotfix 13.0.5-13.0.130*** (NOT Refresh 11, or hotfix 13.0.131+)

The reason this is not meant for 131 and above, is at hotfix 131 Kentico enabled .net 8 and a no-jQuery dependency mode, which included updates to the Form Javascript and such.  This starting site separated out the form javascript and jquery to optimize things, however in hotfix 131 these files changed.

A new starting site will soon be available that will be for 13.0.131 onwards, that will feature .net 8.0, no jQuery, the updated form javascripts optimized, and using the new V2 Baseline refactored code.
