# Site.Library
This should contain:
* Kentico Agnostic but usually MVC Specific Extensions and Helpers
* Repository and Service Implementations that do not require Kentico APIs

This Library should *NOT* reference Kentico in any fashion.

This library should reference:
* `XperienceCommunity.Baseline.Core.Library` Package (along with any other `XperienceCommmunity.Baseline._____.Library`)
* `Site.Models` Project
