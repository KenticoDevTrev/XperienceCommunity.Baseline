# Overview

The Tabbed Pages module is largely just giving a basic example of a Tabbed Page system using the [PartialWidgetPage](https://github.com/KenticoDevTrev/PartialWidgetPage) System.  It doesn't provide much benefit other than providing a Tag Page and Tab Parent Page Type, a simple repository to retrieve the child Tab Items, and the templates set up and configured to work with the Partial Widget Page System.

You do not need this module if you do not wish the above items, you can simply create your own page types and follow the [partial widget page readme](https://github.com/KenticoDevTrev/PartialWidgetPage) and set up things yourself.
