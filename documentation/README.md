# Baseline Documentation

Please see the below links.  

## Kentico Xperience 13 Notice
While this Baseline was originally built in Kentico Xperience 13, the documentation is such that it assumes you'll be using Xperience by Kentico (as there aren't many reasons to not build in Xperience by Kentico at the point of writing this).

For this reason, **if you are building in Kentico Xperience 13**, please know that there are features that are only in Kentico Xperience 13 that aren't documented here. [The Legacy Kentico Xperience 13 Documentation](https://github.com/HBSTech/Kentico13CoreBaseline/wiki) will have a fuller list, but this may have some items out of date.

Likewise, some features listed in this documentation are only in the Xperience by Kentico version.  I'll do my best to highlight which are Xperience by Kentico only.
