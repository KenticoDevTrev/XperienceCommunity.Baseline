# Search

The Search module, similar to the Tabbed Pages module, is meant to be a working sample.

The Search module uses the Lucene Smart Search (Default OOTB for Kentico Xperience 13, and the [Xperirence by Kentico Lucene](https://github.com/Kentico/xperience-by-kentico-lucene) library for Xperience by Kentico).

There are other Search options out there that you can explore yourself.  This implementation however should cover the most general usage: Scan and index web pages and allow searching of them, display Title, content, and a link.
