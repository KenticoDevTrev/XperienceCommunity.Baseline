# Ecommerce in Xperience by Kentico

As of writing this (1/18/2025), Xperience by Kentico does not have Ecommerce baked in.

It does have a couple repos currently for integrations:

1. [Kentico / xperience-by-kentico-ecommerce-common](https://github.com/Kentico/xperience-by-kentico-ecommerce-common)
2. [Kentico / xperience-by-kentico-shopify](https://github.com/Kentico/xperience-by-kentico-shopify)
3. [Kentico / xperience-by-kentico-k13ecommerce](https://github.com/Kentico/xperience-by-kentico-k13ecommerce)

These allow you to either integrate with Shopify, some other platform, or an existing Kentico Xperience 13 instance from your Xperience by Kentico.

[It is planned on being developed](https://roadmap.kentico.com/c/269-native-e-commerce-module-baseline), at which time I'm sure an updated integration will be present.
