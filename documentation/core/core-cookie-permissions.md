# FUTURE - Cookie Permissions

One thing that is missing in the Baseline that every site should have is a cookie policy.

This is outlined in [Kentico's documentation](https://docs.kentico.com/developers-and-admins/data-protection/cookies#enable-users-to-select-a-preferred-cookie-level) but I do want to have it as part of the Baseline once i do this myself.

Should be there probably over the next couple months.
