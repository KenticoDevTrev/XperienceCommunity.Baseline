# XperienceCommunity.Baseline
Core Systems, Tools, and Structure to ensure a superior Kentico Website that's easy to migrate, for Kentico Xperience 13 and eventually Xperience by Kentico

Special thanks to my previous employer [Heartland Business Systems](https://www.hbs.net) who supported me as I created this baseline, adding things we all learned on projects into this (and other repositories) and allowing me to give them away to the Kentico Community.  If you need help on Baseline projects, I would definitely get in touch with them.

Also special thanks to my current employer [Movement Mortgage](https://www.movement.com) who shares my desire to serve and bless others, and is excited to use this new baseline and grow it as our team works on their site.  If you need a mortgage or insurance, they put their profits towards building schools, churches, and supporting ministries and organizations to help marginalized communities in the name of Jesus.

## Goal
This Baseline's goal is to provide a framework and structure to build Kentico Xperience 13 websites in such a way that they will be easily migrated to Xperience by Kentico, as well as leveraging SOLID coding principles, Internet/SEO/Accessability best practices, and other site optimizing principles.  It also serves as a "Recipe Bin" for widgets, code samples, and other things people may want to contribute to help others as a community.  

## Status
August 3rd, 2023, the Baseline is ready for general usage.  There is still a couple things left to do as listed below, but it's being used on my current project

1. Add Installation steps for the Core, Navigation, Search, and Localization Modules
2. Add Customization points for Navigation, Search, and Localization Modules
6. Add Installation steps for Account, Ecommerce, and Tabbed Pages Modules
7. Add Customization points for Account, Ecommerce, and Tabbed Pages Modules

After these are done, then in 2024 i plan on working on the Xperience by Kentico implementations of each thing.
